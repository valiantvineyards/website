              The Nygaard family's winemaking heritage traces back to <strong class="text-foreground">1850</strong>, when
              Christian F. Gossmann immigrated from Germany to the American Midwest, bringing centuries of
              Old World winemaking knowledge with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to <strong class="text-foreground">1961</strong>. Eldon Nygaard, working from the family
              farm in Turner County, South Dakota, created his first wine using mulberries from their land.
              It was an experiment born from curiosity and family tradition—one that would eventually
              change South Dakota's agricultural landscape.

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              The family planted experimental grape plots, partnering with South Dakota State University's
              Dr. Ann Fennel to identify cold-hardy varieties that could survive brutal Midwest winters.
              Among them: the <em>Valiant</em> grape, developed by Dr. Ronald Peterson—the variety that
              would eventually give the vineyard its name.

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              Recognizing the commercial viability of wine grapes in South Dakota, Eldon—a political
              science professor at the University of South Dakota—did something remarkable. He drafted
              the state's enabling legislation for farm wineries. The Nygaard family testified before
              the state legislature, and on <strong class="text-foreground">July 1, 1996</strong>,
              the Farm Winery Act became law.

              Valiant Vineyards received South Dakota's first commercial bonded winery license.
              They didn't just become the state's first winery—they created the industry itself.

              The family completed a 15,000-square-foot facility at Buffalo Run Resort in Vermillion.
              What started as a mulberry wine experiment on a Turner County farm had grown into a
              full-fledged destination winery.

        <div class="mt-8 space-y-6 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            From the very beginning, this has been a family endeavor. Eldon's children,
            Leif and Jeanette, grew up working in the vineyard—pruning vines, harvesting grapes,
            and helping with bottling runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            By age eighteen, Leif had become a <strong class="text-foreground">sixth-generation American winemaker</strong>.
            Today, he leads Stone Faces Distillery, expanding the family's craft to include vodka,
            whiskey, apple brandy, rum, and bourbon—all made with the same dedication to quality
            and local ingredients that defines Valiant Vineyards.
