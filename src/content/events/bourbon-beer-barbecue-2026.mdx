Join us for an indulgent winter evening of **bourbon, beer, BBQ, and wine** at Valiant Vineyards Winery & Distillery.

**Bourbon, Beer & BBQ Bacchanal** is a celebration of bold flavors—featuring tastings of **over 50 bourbons and spirits**, local craft beer, and our own wines, paired with a full spread of slow-smoked barbecue and comfort-food classics.

To round out the night, enjoy live music from **Paul Weidenbach**, a musician and singer from Parkston. In 2017, he was inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the Precious Cargo Band. Paul brings a smooth, easygoing set of favorites from the '70s and '80s, delivered with a rich baritone voice.
