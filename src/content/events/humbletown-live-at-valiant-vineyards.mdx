**Sunday, November 3rd, at 6 PM**

Formed in the humble prairie town of Vermillion, South Dakota, Humbletown has emerged as a powerful multi-genre bluegrass-inspired ensemble. Now based out of the Black Hills, the band is inspired by the quiet beauty of pine-filled forests, with original songs inspired by their home and travels, intricately performed on clawhammer banjo, flatpick guitar, and upright bass. With music that combines influences of bluegrass, old time, hot club swing, Americana, and classic country, Humbletown will take you on a musical journey that stretches across time and space.

Their 2022 debut album, “The Path I Chose to Walk,” received international acclaim. Americana UK's review described the album: “The first impression on listening to these songs around virtuosos on clawhammer banjo and flat-picking guitar is that this entire collection must have been something discovered nearly a century ago by the great ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax.” Their album's title track video, “Vines,” was premiered by Bluegrass Situation, and Americana Highways described their album as “A little old-time country, folk & bluegrass. The musicianship is stellar, with fingerpicking on acoustic guitar & banjo. The mix of male & female vocals balances the material impressively.”
