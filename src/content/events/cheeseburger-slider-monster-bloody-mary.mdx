Sliding right into summer with these delicious little cheeseburger sliders.

Get them stacked on top of your Monster Bloody Mary or on the side. Bring some friends and try all three sizes! There is a Naked Mary, a Monster Mary, and a Godzilla Bloody Mary with a whole chicken on top! Get any of these sizes as a Bloody, Mimosa, Bourbon lemonade, or beer!
